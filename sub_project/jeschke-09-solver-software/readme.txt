The 'binary' folder contains binaries and the 'source' folder contains sources for the following paper:
Stefan Jeschke, David Cline, Peter Wonka: A GPU Laplacian Solver for Diffusion Curves and Poisson Image Editing. Transaction on Graphics (Siggraph Asia 2009), 28(5):1-8, December 2009.
http://www.cg.tuwien.ac.at/research/publications/2009/jeschke-09-solver/

The sources can be compiled using the DirectX10 SDK (or later).

How to use the viewer: 
- left/middle mouse + move -> move DCI 
- right mouse + mouve -> move DCI with subpixel speed
- mouse wheel -> zoom DCI
- slider -> adjust number of iterations for the diffusion 
- 'm' -> remove statistics and slider (useful for making screen shots)
